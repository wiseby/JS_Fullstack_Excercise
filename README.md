Fullstack in Javascript/Typescript
=====

This projects main goal was to demonstrate the possibility to develope an application font to back in Javascript only. This was accomplished with the following tools:

* Node.js for the server part.

* Angular for Client part.

* Bootstrap 4 to add som css styling.

It also implement both an SPA and Monolithical design to seperate the functionality between regular user and administrators.

Server with Node.js
----
The backend is built with Node.js wich enables serverside runnig application written in javascript. 

These are som packages installed through npm:

* **express generator**
* **crypto.js**
* **body-parser.js**
* **cors.js**

WebClient with Angular 9
---

Modern webdevelopment often uses web-frameworks. This was no exception because the assignment specifications also stated that this was a requirement. I choose Angular 9 instead of React because I was already reaserching it before this project started.
